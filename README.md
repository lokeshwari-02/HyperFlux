Modern web applications rely heavily on APIs for data exchange, but testing and debugging these APIs can be challenging without proper mocking and logging mechanisms. **HyperFlux** addresses this issue by providing an efficient API mocking and logging solution, allowing developers to simulate API responses without relying on a live backend. This enables seamless frontend development, debugging, and performance analysis while ensuring real-time logging of API requests and responses. By integrating robust logging and monitoring, HyperFlux enhances the development workflow, reducing dependency on external servers and improving overall application stability.
